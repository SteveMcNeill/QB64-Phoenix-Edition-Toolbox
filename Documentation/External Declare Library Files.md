#### INCLUDE_GLUT:  Includes all DECLARE LIBRARY routines that come from glut.
	INCLUDE_GLUTGET
	INCLUDE_GLUTRESHAPEWINDOW

#### INCLUDE_MATH:  Include all DECLARE LIBRARY routines related to math functions or subs.
	INCLUDE_ISINF
	INCLUDE_ISNAN

#### INCLUDE_MEM:  Include all DECLARE LIBRARY routines related to mem functions or subs.
	INCLUDE_SETMEMORYBYTE
	INCLUDE_SETMEMORYINTEGER
	INCLUDE_SETMEMORYLONG

#### INDEPENDENT DECLARE LIBRARY subs and functions.
	INCLUDE_GLUTGET:  Adds Function glutget& (ByVal what&)
