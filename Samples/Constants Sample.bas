'Note that this Toolbox has many useful CONST built in for us to make use of,

'For example:

Print "True = "; True
Print "False = "; False
Print
Print "Your program name is: "; MyAppName
Print "The proper slash for your operating system is the: "; Slash
Print
Print "The limits for what a LONG variable can hold without overflowing is: "; Long_Min, Long_Max
Print
Print "The _Keyhit value for the A key is"; Key_A; "(uppercase)", Key_A_Low; "(lowercase)"

Print "Be certain to check the documentation for a complete list of CONST names"
Print "and values, so you can make full use of them in your programming."
